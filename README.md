# ts-playground-plugin-github-explorer

This is a plugin for typescript-playground. It allows you to explore a github repo through the plugins panel, selecting files to fill the code area with.

This was made using [this repo](https://github.com/gojutin/typescript-playground-plugin-svelte) as a template during a TS workshop at Codecademy. 

## Usage
1. clone this repo
2. `cd` into the cloned directory
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run start` or `yarn start`
5. navigate to the typescript playground, go to the options panel, and tick "`Connect to localhost:5000`"
